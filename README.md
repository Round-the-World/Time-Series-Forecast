# Time-Series-Forecast
Time series forecasts using ARIMA models and neural network based architecture (CNN, LSTM, MLP, etc.) with python
This project focuses on time series forcasts using different models and data sets. 
First an ARIMA model is used for time series prediction using a number of sales of E-bikes in germany data set.
Step by step the model parameters (p,d,q) are estimated and validated with different statistical method, followed by optimizing AIC. 
Furthermore the model plausibility regarding real market circumstances are analysed and the model quality is evaluated.
